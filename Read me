In Microsft Word, type a symbol name between two colons, e.g.

PCl5 (g) :equilibrium: PCl3 (g) + Cl2 (g) 
Then run the macro and it is convertewd to 
PCl5 (g) ⇌ PCl3 (g) + Cl2 (g) 

or 

:delta:G:degrees: = -RT ln(K)
ΔG° = -RT ln(K) 


There are only a few so far

:equilibrium:
:degrees:
:squareroot:
:approximately:
:arrow:
:sigma:
:delta:
